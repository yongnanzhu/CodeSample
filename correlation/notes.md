# Correlation explorer notes

## TO DO

* ? Gray lines when mouse-on
* Importance, principal component, linkage sorts?
* Make sorting more consistent
	* Alphabetic and Orginal as buttons 
* pseudo-symmetric sort, when first one axis, then automatically along the other
* Bootstrap or some other nice interface? Or rather keep it bare-bone?
* Easier search for / filtering variables?
* Some listing of previously loaded csv files?
* Some scales, not only -1 to 1 (so it will be usable also for counts)
* Inspiration: http://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/

## TO THINK

* How to work with many variables?
	* Make first n variables bigger?
* If and how allow more datapoints per pixes (e.g. also Spearman correl)
* How to expand it into a 2d scatter/histogram plot per each correlation?
* Show how much position changed?
